# UNIVERSE SPINE: VEIL VERSE

## 1. CORE THEMES (Immutable)
- **The Cost of Progress**: Every technological leap requires a spiritual or physical sacrifice.
- **The Veil is Thin**: Reality is a fragile skin over a chaotic, ancient underverse.
- **Memory as Currency**: In a digital world, true memory is the only un-hackable resource.
- **Mars as the Grave**: The Red Planet is not a new beginning; it is a tomb of a previous iteration of humanity.

## 2. RULES OF CAUSALITY
- **Energy Conservation**: Magic/Psionics uses calories. Overuse leads to starvation/death.
- **Tech-Rot**: Advanced tech from the "Golden Age" decays faster than modern tech. It is cursed.
- **Echoes**: Traumatic events leave "Echoes" in the Veil that can be replayed or weaponized.

## 3. MYTH LOGIC
- **Xoah's Law**: "If you stare into the void, the void charges you rent." (Entities require acknowledgement to exist).
- **The Architects**: They are not gods; they are admins of a simulation that has been abandoned.
- **Shadow Dwellers**: Viruses in the source code of reality.

## 4. TIMELINE ANCHORS
- **Year 2045**: The Great Collapse. Internet fragmentation.
- **Year 2088**: First Contact (Mars). The "Signal" is received.
- **Year 2100**: The Veil Breach. Xoah-Lin Oda stabilizes the rift.
- **Year 2150 (Present)**: The Reconstruction Era. Corporations fight for Veil scraps.
- **Year 3000 (The End)**: The Heat Death / System Reset.
