# Universe Spine Template

## 1) Elevator Premise
**What Changed**: Mass drivers made orbital transport cheap, leading to massive expansion. Orbit became sovereign territory, distinct from Earth nations.
**What Broke**: Kinetic strikes (Six Hour War) shattered the peace. Corporate wars and the High Rider revolt fractured the orbital unity.
**Unresolved**: The Pathfinders are missing. Jupiter is a silent void. The "Angle Signal" remains decoded.

## 2) The Three Power Layers
**Earth Layer**: Fractured, economically dependent on orbital logistics. Vulnerable to kinetic coercion from orbit.
**Orbital Layer**: Initially ESA dominance. Now contested by High Rider Confederation (secessionist labor) and Corporate private stations. Crystal Palace is the symbol and chokepoint.
**Frontier Layer**: Mars is resources + research + political wildcard. Jupiter is the unanswered question that destabilizes everyone's plans.

## 3) Factions
**ESA (European Space Agency)**:
*   **Goal**: Monopoly on orbit through infrastructure and doctrine.
*   **Method**: High-tech fleets, political legitimacy.
*   **Leverage**: Control of the launch windows and financing.
*   **Fear**: Loss of control to the "mob" (High Riders).

**High Rider Confederation**:
*   **Goal**: Autonomy, labor dignity, control of habitat chokepoints.
*   **Method**: Strikes, sabotage, cultural cohesion.
*   **Leverage**: Turning off the lights/air/transport.
*   **Fear**: Being purged by Earth militaries.

**Corporations (Micro-states)**:
*   **Goal**: Profit, evasion of Earth law, private fiefdoms.
*   **Method**: Security outsourcing, manufacturing monopolies.
*   **Leverage**: Money and goods Earth needs.
*   **Fear**: Nationalization or total war destroying assets.

## 4) Timeline Arcs
**Act 1: Build the Ladder (1991-2000)**: Kilimanjaro mass driver, Tycho bootstrap, return pipeline.
**Act 2: Build the Throne (2000-2011)**: Crystal Palace, war delays, orbit militarizes, Six Hour War, warning strikes.
**Act 3: Expand then Fracture (2011-2022)**: Corporate stations, Japan pressure, cultural divergence of High Riders.
**Act 4: Secession and Diaspora (2022+)**: Kill sat near miss, O'Neill 2 revolt, orbit fractures into polities. Moon control contested. Mars governance emerges. Jupiter remains missing.

## 5) Key Set Pieces
*   **Mass Driver Launch Control Room**: The nerve center of Earth-to-Orbit logistics.
*   **Crystal Palace Concourse**: Luxury, casinos, and the security ring. The face of the new order.
*   **O'Neill 2 Labor Decks**: Where the High Riders live. Gritty, industrial, culturally distinct.
*   **Tycho Ice Mine Tunnels**: dark, dangerous, essential resource extraction.
*   **LEO Debris War Zone**: Salvage lanes where scavengers pick through the ruins of war.

## 6) Mystery Hooks
*   What really happened to the Pathfinders after 2023?
*   Why did the 2010 ESA + USSR Mars attempt retreat?
*   Are "The Angels" real, or a cover story?
*   Who benefits from keeping Jupiter unresolved?

## 7) Tone Constraints
*   Space is not romantic; it is expensive violence and brittle survival.
*   Every "miracle tech" has a supply chain and a choke point.
*   Language and culture are weapons, not decoration.
