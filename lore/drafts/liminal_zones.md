# DRAFT: Liminal Zones — Veil Pockets & Transitional Spaces

> [!NOTE]
> Canon Status: DRAFT — Pending Review

## Overview
A liminal zone is a place of transition — a threshold between two states where reality hasn't fully committed to being one thing or another.
In VeilVerse, these spaces exist where the Veil is thin — areas that feel familiar but wrong, where probability hasn't collapsed, where time doesn't flow normally, and where the boundary between observer and observed becomes dangerously unclear.
The Substrata is full of them. And they're spreading.

## Real-World Basis

### Liminality Concept
Liminal (from Latin limen, "threshold") describes transitional spaces:
- Airports at 3 AM
- Schools during summer break
- Houses after someone moves out
- Abandoned shopping malls
These spaces create psychological discomfort because they're meant for people but empty — places of transition where no one is supposed to stay.

### The Backrooms
From Y-Files extraction:
The Backrooms concept: reality has seams, and if you slip through, you end up in transitional space that goes on forever.

## VeilVerse Application

### Why Liminal Zones Exist
Remember: observation collapses reality (see Quantum-Consciousness Mechanics draft).
Liminal zones occur where:

### Characteristics

## Types of Liminal Zones

### Type 1: Natural Veil Pockets
Cause: Areas where Architect observation infrastructure has degraded
Characteristics:
- Stable but uncanny
- Reality "settles" when observed, destabilizes when observer leaves
- Can be mapped, but maps become inaccurate over time
- Relatively safe if you keep moving
Examples in Olympus Mons:
- Abandoned maintenance corridors in Mid-Tier
- Sealed sections of the Soul-Tether Rail
- Old refugee processing centers in Lower Rings

### Type 2: Collapsed Observation Sites
Cause: Places where a traumatic event created a "fixed probability well" — the Veil locked to a single terrible moment
Characteristics:
- Replays the same event endlessly
- Observers get pulled into the replay
- Time passes normally outside but loops inside
- Extremely dangerous — can trap people for perceived years
Examples:
- The site of Xoah's parents' deaths (Valles Marineris excavation)
- Nyx's first blade contact location
- Corbin's original betrayal site

### Type 3: Architect Threshold Zones
Cause: Deliberately designed spaces meant to remain in superposition
Characteristics:
- Stable but deeply wrong
- Geometry doesn't follow physics (bigger inside than outside)
- May contain "living memories" — recordings of the past playing on loop
- Purpose unknown — possibly testing chambers, storage, or gateways
Examples:
- Level Zero (the deepest Substrata level)
- The Core Chamber's outer ring
- Certain corridors that appear on no map

### Type 4: Active Instability Zones
Cause: Ongoing conflict between observers collapsing contradictory outcomes
Characteristics:
- Extremely dangerous and unstable
- Reality shifts based on who's observing
- Multiple "versions" of the same space overlay each other
- Can cause permanent psychological damage
Examples:
- Combat sites where multiple Veil-Touched fight
- Areas near awakening Veil artifacts
- The space immediately around the Shadow Blade during activation

## Cross-Reference: Existing Canon

### The Substrata as Liminal Space
From Olympus Mons Mega-Pyramid:
Level Zero is a Type 3 threshold zone — deliberately designed to remain uncollapsed.

### Ghost's Transformation
From Olympus Mons Mega-Pyramid:
Ghost has adapted to liminal space. The Substrata's superposition has become comfortable — normal reality now feels wrong.

### The Black Loop
From Xoah-Lin Oda Profile:
The Black Loop may be a Type 2 collapsed observation site — a place where trauma has locked reality into repetition.
