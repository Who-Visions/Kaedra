# DRAFT: The Sea People — Post-Cataclysm Knowledge Transfer

> [!NOTE]
> Canon Status: DRAFT — Pending Review

## Overview
When the Architects fell, not everyone died.
A small group — perhaps hundreds, perhaps thousands — survived in deep shelters, sealed away from the atmospheric collapse. They emerged into a dead world, their civilization gone, their technology failing. But they carried something precious: knowledge.
Over generations, these survivors spread across Mars and eventually Earth, teaching primitive humans the foundations of civilization. Every ancient culture remembers them. The Sumerians called them the Apkallu. The Egyptians knew Thoth. The Greeks spoke of Prometheus. The Aztecs honored Quetzalcoatl.
They are the Sea People — so named because they always arrived from across the water, bearing gifts of wisdom.

## Real-World Basis

### Universal Flood Myths
From Y-Files extraction (Gobeklitepe):

### The Teacher Archetype
Every ancient culture has a civilizing teacher:
All appear after a great disaster. All come from the water or from the sky. All teach the same knowledge.

## VeilVerse Application

### The Survival
When the Martian Cataclysm struck, the Architect leadership had hours of warning. They initiated Protocol Seedline:
Approximately 3,000 Architects entered stasis. When they emerged 50,000 years later:
- Mars was dead
- Their technology was degraded but functional
- The surface was uninhabitable
- They had to leave

### The Exodus
Using remaining spacecraft, the survivors traveled to Earth. They found:
- A primitive humanity (homo sapiens, ~100,000 years ago)
- A habitable planet with copper deposits
- Potential to restart Architect civilization
But they were too few, too weakened. They couldn't rebuild alone.
So they became teachers.

## The Teaching Period

### Phase 1: Direct Contact (~100,000 - 50,000 BCE)
Survivors established bases and made direct contact with human tribes:
- Taught basic agriculture and animal husbandry
- Introduced writing systems (pictographic)
- Shared astronomical knowledge
- Interbred with humans (creating high-VRC bloodlines)
Humans remembered them as gods.

### Phase 2: Hidden Guidance (~50,000 - 12,000 BCE)
As survivors aged and died, their descendants continued the work:
- More indirect influence
- Established mystery schools
- Created sacred sites aligned with astronomical events
- Preserved knowledge in myths and symbols
Humans remembered them as demigods and heroes.

### Phase 3: The Younger Dryas Reset (~12,900 - 11,600 BCE)
From existing canon (Xoah profile):
Another cataclysm struck — this time on Earth. The comet swarm that created the Younger Dryas destroyed most remaining Architect descendants and their human students.
But some survived. Again.

### Phase 4: The Broken Veil Lineage (11,600 BCE - Present)
From existing canon:
The survivors reorganized. They called themselves the Broken Veil Lineage — keepers of knowledge from before the Veil was "broken" by the cataclysm.
Their mission:

## Cross-Reference: Existing Canon

### The Oda Lineage
From Xoah-Lin Oda Profile:
Proposed expansion:
The BVL identified the Oda family as carrying exceptionally high VRC concentration. They orchestrated events to:
- Protect the bloodline through Japanese history
- Arrange marriages that concentrated VRC genes
- Eventually produce Xoah — the culmination of centuries of breeding

### The Haitian Connection
From existing canon:
The Beloc Formation in Haiti contains Architect materials. Haitian spiritual traditions (Vodou) developed around this site because:
- The Veil is naturally stronger there
- Sea People survivors established a base nearby
- Vodou practices accidentally preserved VRC-enhancing rituals
- Generations of practitioners selected for Veil sensitivity
Xoah's Haitian-Japanese heritage isn't coincidence. It's the convergence of two BVL bloodline programs.
