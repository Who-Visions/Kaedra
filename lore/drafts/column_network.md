# DRAFT: The Column Network — Substrata Infrastructure Systems

> [!NOTE]
> Canon Status: DRAFT — Pending Review

## Overview
The Substrata isn't just ruins. It's a functioning city — one that's been running on autopilot for 3 million years.
At the heart of every major Architect settlement stands a Column: a 700-foot tower that regulates climate, generates light, manages airflow, and maintains the systems keeping the underground habitable. The Columns are why the Substrata has breathable air. They're why the temperature is stable. They're why explorers sometimes find lights that still work.
The Architects are gone. Their machines are not.

## Real-World Basis

### Underground City Mysteries
From Y-Files extraction (Lacerta Files):
Real underground structures show engineering beyond their supposed technological level:
- Derinkuyu (Turkey): 18 levels, housed 20,000 people
- Malta Hypogeum: Acoustic chambers tuned to 110 Hz
- Longyou Caves (China): 2,000-year-old caverns with no tool marks

## VeilVerse Application

### Column Structure
Each Column is approximately 700 feet tall and serves multiple functions:
Lower Section (0-200 ft):
- Geothermal tap — draws heat from Mars's core
- Power generation — converts thermal energy to electricity
- Waste processing — breaks down organic material
Middle Section (200-500 ft):
- Atmosphere generation — produces breathable air
- Climate control — maintains stable temperature
- Water cycling — extracts and purifies moisture
Upper Section (500-700 ft):
- Artificial sunlight — spectrum-correct illumination
- Communication relay — connects to other Columns
- Veil interface — synchronizes with The Breathing

### The Network
Columns don't operate independently. They form a network across the Substrata:
When one Column degrades, others compensate. This is why some Substrata areas are well-lit and temperate while others are dark and cold.

## Cross-Reference: Existing Canon

### The Substrata Environment
From Olympus Mons Mega-Pyramid:
Proposed expansion:
The Forgotten don't just survive in the Substrata — they've learned to use the Columns:
- Know which areas have working climate control
- Can access limited Column functions
- Trade "good air zones" as territory
- Some have learned to tap Column power

### Why Breath Stones Work
From existing canon:
Proposed connection:
Breath Stones are degraded Column output — crystallized byproducts of the atmosphere generation process. The Columns produce breathable air; over millions of years, excess production crystallized in the surrounding rock.
This explains:
- Why Breath Stones are found near Architect structures
- Why they're more common deeper in the Substrata
- Why they "resonate" with Veil energy (Column Veil interface)

## Column Functions

### Artificial Sunlight
The upper sections of functional Columns emit light that mimics solar radiation:
- Full spectrum (visible, UV, infrared)
- Follows a day/night cycle (though timing varies by Column)
- Some sections haven't had "daylight" in millennia
The Forgotten in well-lit areas have adapted. Those in dark zones have... changed.

### Atmosphere Generation
The Columns don't just circulate air — they create it:
- Extract oxygen from Martian rock
- Filter toxins and particulates
- Maintain pressure differential with surface
- Add trace elements for biological compatibility
This is why the deep Substrata is habitable when Mars's surface requires pressure suits.

### The 47-Minute Pulse
From existing canon:
The Columns synchronize with The Breathing:
- Light brightens slightly during pulse
- Air pressure fluctuates microscopically
- Power output spikes
- Veil-sensitive individuals feel the Column "wake up"
During the pulse, Column systems run at full capacity. Between pulses, they operate at minimal levels.

## Degradation & Failure

### 3 Million Years of Decay
The Columns were built to last, but entropy is patient:

### The East Quadrant Collapse
~500 years ago, the East Quadrant Column failed completely. Within days:
- Atmosphere vented
- Temperature dropped to -60°C
- All biological life died
- The area became a frozen tomb
The Forgotten speak of the "Cold Dark" as a warning. When a Column fails, everything within its coverage area dies.

## Accessing Column Systems

### The Forgotten's Knowledge
Generations of Substrata dwellers have developed techniques:
- Light Calling: Tapping patterns that trigger emergency lighting
- Warm Zones: Identifying Column heat vents for shelter
