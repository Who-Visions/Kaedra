Once upon a time. &gt;&gt; What's behind a voice? A fighting man. &gt;&gt; For 6 years and over 300 videos, Paul Gregory was the inimitable voice of Studio Binder. &gt;&gt; What happens after the good guys win? After the hero saves the day. &gt;&gt; And he was a whole lot more than that. &gt;&gt; And that's just as it should be. Paul Gregory was an actor whose career spanned decades and different mediums. He was born in Mumbai. His father was in the military and his family moved from India to East Africa to London. Starting out as an actor, he was mentored by Sir Lawrence Olivier at the National Theater at the Old Vic. He studied and performed Shakespeare intensely and went on to star in 19 stage productions with the Royal National and Royal Shakespeare Companies. His career in film stretched as far back as the 60s. He even played a police officer in the Beatles movie Magical Mystery Tour. In 1989, his familiarity with the bird landed him the role of West Merland in the film adaptation of Henry V where he performed across Kenneth Brana. &gt;&gt; All things are ready if our minds be so. &gt;&gt; Punish the man whose mind is backward now. &gt;&gt; Let us not wish more help from England cuz God's will my lege. Would you and I alone without more help could fight this royal battle? &gt;&gt; All had extensive experience in other media too. You got 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; He appeared in TV shows like Jimmy Kimmel Life. Just last week, as I was wiping him, sweet Matthew mistook me for an Ottoman. &gt;&gt; True blood. &gt;&gt; You're too late. The postules are formed. &gt;&gt; Show me to her. &gt;&gt; Yet shorty. &gt;&gt; Oh, hello, Miles. &gt;&gt; How do you know Jenny? &gt;&gt; She's a friend. &gt;&gt; You know, when Jenny was 5 years old. &gt;&gt; Oh, this story. We were having an Easter egg hunt on the back lawn. Except the adults were &gt;&gt; You're up. &gt;&gt; To be continued. &gt;&gt; An NCI. &gt;&gt; Well, we may not agree on much, but there is one thing. &gt;&gt; As a voice actor, he lent his talents to video games. &gt;&gt; I refuse to believe it. The Lord Chancellor will permit me. I can &gt;&gt; shall not permit. &gt;&gt; As well as audio books and documentaries. Named after his father's jazz trio, he was Prince Rogers Nelson. &gt;&gt; He had five children, most of whom also did their fair share of acting. His daughter, Gemma, even acted across him in an episode of The Bill. &gt;&gt; Hit me on the head, kicked me. I think &gt;&gt; the doctor said she's had a blow to the head, but they're letting her go home later this morning. Of course, Paul was also a beloved part of the Studio Binder team. &gt;&gt; The camera takes an extra 5 seconds to catch up. &gt;&gt; And we finally get to see what Allan saw. &gt;&gt; His passion for all things film making was infectious. &gt;&gt; And he loved to read comments from fans left on her videos. He was a consumate professional who never once showed up late to a recording session, though he still knew how to have some fun. Can you do it in German, please? &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. That's the best German accent I've heard read in a French accent in my life. &gt;&gt; He may be gone, but the work he has done with Studio Binder and beyond will live on, and the countless people who had the honor of spending time with him won't forget him. Thank you for everything, Paul. We'll miss you. We've arrived at the dumour of this video. We hope you found it resolute. Until next time. Good luck, young Padawan. May the force be with you. With every beginning comes an ending, and this is ours. See you next time.
