thank you very much every great filmmaker starts somewhere by studying the Legends first films we can learn a lot about the craft and be better prepared to make features of our own we very privileged to see it it's very rare here are the lessons we learned from studying how Christopher Nolan made following before we follow Nolan's advice subscribe to Studio binder and click the Bell icon to enable notifications anyway down to business business following is a story of a writer somebody wants to be a writer who's living in London very busy City and uh he takes to following individual people picking someone out of the crowd seeing where they go what they do and and becomes addicted to this quite frankly shadowing following I started to follow people who anyone first um I mean that was the whole point somebody at random somebody didn't know who I was and then and then nothing nothing nothing I just see where they went what they did go home afterwards following was Christopher Nolan's debut feature but it was far from his first film I started making films when I was a kid when I was I think seven years old making films using my dad's Super Eight camera and action figures doing stop motion films a little bit of Animation a certain amount of live action and I just carried on making films as I grew up this background in cinema production set the stage for Nolan to pursue a career in filmmaking many people assume that you need to go to film school to become a successful filmmaker George Lucas Francis Ford copela and Spike Lee hold degrees from some of America's preeminent programs but Nolan took another route I'm a self-taught filmmaker I never went to film school I never studied film making in any way as the price of film schools continue to rise and more educational resources become available online there's perhaps never been a better time to become a self-taught filmmaker it's worth noting that Nolan did procure a bachelor's degree in English literature from the University College of London and served as the president of the school's Film Society so even though he didn't go to film School per se he took full advantage of the resources made available from studying a different subject now look at the books they're college educated probably graduated when they 21 or 22 moved in together in the last year could tell more from the music you should consider starting small before tackling a feature Nolan made a variety of shorts before making following the experience of making Doodlebug over a weekend helped him prepare for the production of following we were sort of shooting a short film every weekend so it would be a you know a 2-minute 3 minute chunk of the film done every every weekend and that was the approach we took Nolan decided to write the film in a way that would work with the stopandgo shooting schedule the film was shot one day a week for nearly a year as Nolan and the rest of the team had to work around other obligations it was a challenge to scale from a short film to a feature but Nolan got it done by shooting in batches you s it all through I thought it all through every filmmaker has their own set of skills you should think about how you can work in different capacities and leverage your experience Nolan described working as a camera and sound technician for a media training company while making following I actually learned a lot doing that kind of video camera work learned a lot about going into an environment using a couple of Lights setting up very fast and then having to to do something to a to a very rigorous schedule oh you startled us are you from the agency or are you viewing like us what are you doing in my FL oh didn't the agent tell you we'd be here this afternoon but we're not moving you must be the film school or not try to find work in the production World in any capacity even if it's not in an area you ultimately want to be all experience is good experience oh yeah well next time you can do the prep work no no I didn't mean it no I mean it take your mark check it out for days months years whatever it'll be the next place we hit yeah all right Christopher Nolan may be known nowadays for movies with big budgets but his career certainly didn't start out that way I I do it for the money what do you do for the atrinity and because like you I'm interested in people he described following as a no-budget effort from the outset Nolan knew that he had to make some tough choices those choices could be seen as limitations but we looked at them I I sort of sat down and thought okay what are they going to be and then wrote the script with those in mind very much shooting in color versus black and white was a huge consideration there were several limitations that that you you put on that we hadn't adhered to in in earlier short films that things like shooting in black and white was embraced as a limitation but noan ackn knowledges you have to be smart about limitations you should ask yourself what are the things that really betray the budget to the audience one important thing to consider is the sound Nolan made a point to start the film with a highquality voiceover to lure the audience into a sense of budget before the audio broke down the following is my explanation well more of an account of what happened just because you're working with limited resources doesn't mean you can't conceal it to the audience these lessons won't mean anything unless we carry them forward Nolan learned a lot from making following the technical expertise he garnered by working on all facets of the film has made him one of the Modern Masters of the medium I think that getting a strong technical grounding was very important for me and learning how to photograph things on film expose the film correctly choose the film stops those kind of things has served me extremely well as I've gone into bigger and bigger films Nolan's expertise allows him to easily spot misinformation when I first came to Hollywood and made momento at the time everyone was pushing super 35 as a medium over anamorphic and when you knew the reality of it and the science of it and the physics of it it's it's a vast inferior format I had to know that myself so that when I interviewed DPS and I would ask them you know would you shot have superi would you should have anamorphic their answer would tell me a lot about how much they knew technically another major thing Nolan carried forward was cross cutting the thing that I started to develop on following that I've carried on ever since that has most Ser is probably cross cutting cross cutting has become part of Nolan signature Style Nolan also learned it can be effective to act OS scene before rolling this technique is known as a dry tape and it's something he also employed when making the dark night to me it was interesting that someone you learned you know on a tiny film was absolutely essential to to this enormous film you know you remind me of my father I hat my father perhaps nobody knows better than Nolan the important role camera technology plays in capturing the right aesthetic I've always looked for the most expedient technology the technology that can get you to where you need to go but always tried to hold on to what's going to be the the best quality for the film what's going to have the richest feel to it over his career noran has used small handheld cameras and huge IMAX cameras of course it's nice to have access access to the latest and greatest cameras you're developing in taste but Nolan suggests it's less about the technology itself than it is how it's used filmmakers should always think about the future you shouldn't let the next project distract you from what you're currently working on I've always felt very strongly that every film you do you can't ever view it as a stepping stone to making another film but you should consider the reality of working in the business if you take a film to a festival you should be prepared to answer the question what's next Nolan wrote the script for momento while finishing following it wasn't conscious on my part to have another scripts that of ready to go by the time we went to you know film festivals with following and in retrospect it was a massive Advantage because it was able to say okay you you like that film this is what I want to do next it can be difficult to juggle two projects but that's the challenge of working in film is that about it yeah I guess that covers the useful stuff Nolan described the experience of making following by saying I would never try to do something like that it was mad really but that's the joy of when you're first starting out you only have one first feature film so make it special it may seem crazy but there is a certain ecstasy in turning a dream into reality what are some of your favorite directorial feature debuts let us know in the comments below and
