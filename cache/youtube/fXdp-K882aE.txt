of film this piece of film must be up on the screen this is what happened man where are those other where is this part of the film what are you going to have a blank spot on the film what are you going to do you got to find each missing piece and tape this in like with many other elements of filmm digital technology has democratized editing if you have a computer you can edit so for a techsavvy filmmaker working with a very tight budget editing your movie yourself may be the best way to go and the Oscar goes to Anora Sean Baker editing your own film has its perks you can control your own destiny putting as many hours into your project as you feel it needs Shane kth for example worked on his cut of primer for 2 years this kind of time commitment would be much more difficult to get out of an editor for hire who may have to prioritize projects that can offer them more money but of course there is a reason editing one's own film is rare it can be inviable to get another person's eyes on a project especially someone who isn't influenced by what they saw and set and who has more experience putting a movie together in the editing room the solution then can be similar to how you may Source the rest of your crew find an editor who is personally invested in the movie and will put in the work without a large paycheck for the relatively lowbudget everything everywhere all at once the Daniels tapped editor Paul Rogers who also happened to be a good friend of theirs the three collaborated on the film remotely sending different cuts to to each other throughout the process Rogers describes this film was made by a lot of friends so every day I was kind of spending time with these people that I cared about even if I wasn't seeing them I I was looking at their work and I was proud of them and and excited and also I felt a lot of pressure because I didn't want to do to do wrong by them you pay attention I cannot talk unless you can help me with my taxes but reaching picture lock is only the beginning budgeting will always need to cover finishing costs such as sound and color to Now Pronounce You as husband and wife you may seal your promises with a can there are a few ways to save money when it comes to creating your soundscape if you were like David Lynch or Shane kth you can take on the sound design yourself for skinnamarink director Kyle Edward ball cut cost by sourcing his sound effects from a free online database the same goes for the film score John Carpenter describes his Penny pitching approach to the iconic music of Halloween which he composed and performed himself I had to do the music to Halloween in about three days we had to do the whole score so I could go in and perform it and get out a soundtrack may also require licensing pre-existing music depending on the song this can be a steep cost so the first rule of thumb is to avoid well-known music then reach out to the musician or their label personally to pitch them on your film and why their song is perfect for it Jim Cummings explains his approach to getting Apex Twin in his trailer I cut it to that song and then reached out to warp records and they were like uh send us the movie and then uh I sent them the trailer and then send them the movie and they were like oh yeah that's totally fine use it for color it can be more difficult to work around budget limitations because it's such a specialized in technical skill finding a colorist for cheap is rare though not impossible Christopher Nolan found one way to avoid paying a lot for coloring on following removing color all together the nice thing about black and white is you eliminate one massive set of variables in terms of balancing your lights with the natural daylight that's surround them and finally there are visual effects the simplest solution to reducing your VFX budget is by reducing the amount of VFX required in your film this begins in your script but it can also o mean leaning on practical effects I got you the Green Knight for example pulled off stunning Fantastical effects with relatively little resources and VFX supervisor Eric Sanden explains that much of this was because of the Practical work that went on set David Lowry allowed us to take the performances that work best and fit the performance in between the mountains and block them walking around then we went back in and refined it this was not CG but in camera effects stitching together lots of environments cutting VFX cost can result from experimentation and thinking outside the box for the Creator director Gareth Edwards bucked the typical VFX process which usually involves expensive pre-planning and the hiring of concept and previs artists who outline what the look of the movie will be instead Edwards opted for something different let's shoot the movie Let's edit it and then when we know what's in the film let's give those frames to our designer James Klein and his team and they can paint in the science fiction exactly what's in the movie so it's like a way more efficient thing once your film is complete there's still more work to be done while distribution and marketing are technically outside of the film making process for low-budget films they can often fall on the shoulders of the filmmaker so this is all we got left so you guys can't be just putting them everywhere you got to put them strategically okay got it do you have it Mike yes without distribution and marketing no one will see the movie you've worked so hard on so it's important to consider these elements when making and budgeting your film the most common route for low-budget features to obtain traditional distribution is through festivals almost all the films mentioned in this series so far found distribution that way but securing distribution isn't a given particularly depending on the festival your film premieres at bigger Distributors usually only attend bigger name festivals like Sundance Tiff and can but if your film gets enough Buzz at a smaller Festival it can have a chance at getting the attention of a distributor as well while it's more rare a low-budget film can also find distribution outside the festival circuit with both the Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 Sam Ry rented out theaters and made his premieres as over- the toop as possible parking ambulances out front and designing custom tickets this drove up word of mouth and helped Remy get meetings with Distributors and then that is the stupidest thing I ever heard of Jesus Christ today distribution isn't only made possible by distribution companies a filmmaker can decide distribute their film themselves this can mean anything from Simply posting their movie YouTube or putting it up on VOD Services if you take this path you will likely also be in charge of your own marketing as well large budget films are usually able to rely on their stars to participate in press junkets and Garner interest low-budget movies meanwhile typically don't have this option available to them so they need to create Intrigue simply through the content of their film with social media it is simpler than ever to create your own marketing campaign at very little cost skining for example generated Word of Mouth buzz after pieces of it were leaked on Tik Tok this attention eventually earned skin marit's own more official distribution deal with a theatrical and streaming release high impact marketing for low-budget films often relies on thinking outside the box Paranormal Activity shot for roughly $15,000 used a night vision camera to film a test screening's audience reaction it then used that footage as its primary advertisement spreading the word that it was a terrifying film not for the faint of heart the result was a box office phenomenon one last thing I want to thank the academy for recognizing a truly independent film this film was made on the Blood Sweat and Tears of incredible Indie artists and um Long Live independent film yeah okay thanks the first rule of lowbudget postproduction there are no rules perhaps more than any other Stage post- production can be what you make of it and what your film requires whether you take matters into your own hands or work with a tight-knit group all that matters is getting your fil across the Finish Line feeling inspired get started with Studio binders pre-production software that's all for now remember the Indie process can be grueling but in the end it can be just as rewarding
